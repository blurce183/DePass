# DePass - Secure Password Generator

DePass is a lightweight, high-security password generator that runs entirely in your browser. It uses cryptographic-grade entropy to ensure your passwords are as secure as possible.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **High Entropy:** Uses `window.crypto` for generating truly random values based on hardware noise.
- **Privacy First:** No data is sent to any server. Everything happens locally on your device.
- **Session History:** Keeps track of your last generated passwords during the current session.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or trackers.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open the tool in your browser.
2. Select your desired options (Numbers, Symbols).
3. Adjust the **character length** using the slider (up to 64 characters).
4. Click **Generate** to create a new password.
5. Click **Copy** to save it to your clipboard.
6. Use the **History** section to retrieve previous passwords from the current session.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

DePass is designed to be a "key factory." We recommend using it in combination with a professional password manager like **Proton Pass** or **Bitwarden**.
